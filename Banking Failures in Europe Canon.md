History of Banking Failures
-----------------------------
Ever since banks were created the possibility that they could fail has been present. The causes for failure 
in the first banks were due to mismanagement or external factors that banks did not foresee and were 
not prepared to face. One of the first documented cases of a banking failure in Europe is the Amsterdam 
banking crisis of 1763. This crisis came about because the banking sector in the Netherlands had borrowed 
heavily using basic goods as collateral (a guarantee of payment), these goods were sold at a higher price 
than usual due to the Seven Year’s War. When the war was over the prices of the basic goods fell 
dramatically and the amount of money available decreased to a point where intervention by the Bank of 
Amsterdam was required to provide enough money for the banking system. Throughout the rest of the 
18th and 19th centuries most of the banking failures were triggered by mismanagement in banks and/or 
critical loss of confidence from the depositors in the ability of the banks to repay the money that had been 
deposited in their institutions. Notable examples of these situations are the Panics of 1825 and 1866. In 
the year of 1825 a stock market crash in London that was caused from reckless investments in Latin 
America caused the collapse of six banks in London, this event is considered to mark the beginning of the 
modern economic cycles due to the fact that the panic was not caused by an external event but rather by 
speculative behavior. In the 1866 crisis, the failure of a bank called Overend, Gurney and Co. again because 
of mismanagement, prompted the failure of over 200 companies. In the 20th century the worst banking 
crisis was the Great Depression in United States. This event in 1929 was caused by a crash in the American 
Stock Market. Four years later 11,000 of United States 25,000 banks had failed and at the height of the 
Great Depression unemployment had risen to 25%. In the 21st Century we have already had a severe 
banking crisis. This crisis was again brought about by mismanagement and lack of oversight from 
regulating authorities which led to essentially banks betting that housing prices would continue to rise, 
leading to a “housing bubble”. Banks lent money to people who were not credit worthy, and they 
eventually could not pay back, which led to the banks losing money on the money they could not recover
